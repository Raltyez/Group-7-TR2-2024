## Justification
The demand for personalized apparel is rapidly increasing in today's market, driven by consumers' desire for unique self-expression. Traditional retail stores often lack the variety and customization options that modern customers seek. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping has become a significant factor in purchasing decisions. Market research indicates a growing trend towards online customization platforms for clothing, highlighting the need for innovative ICT solutions in this sector. Existing ICT solutions in the market offer limited customization options and may not provide an intuitive user experience. Many platforms lack integration with virtual assistants, which can enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Therefore, there is a clear opportunity to develop a comprehensive custom shirt designing website that caters to the evolving needs of consumers.
