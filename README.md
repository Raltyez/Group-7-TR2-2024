# CP 3407 Group-7 Project Title: Custom Shirt Designer

## Project Description
Custom Shirt Designer is an innovative website that allows users to design and purchase custom shirts tailored to their preferences. Users can select the size and color for the shirt base, create or choose specific designs, and complete the purchase online. The platform ensures a smooth user experience from customization to delivery, featuring secure online payment and efficient order delivery. Additionally, it offers a dedicated section for users to view their past orders and track current ones. The integrated virtual assistant provides real-time assistance with design choices, order processes, and any queries, making Custom Shirt Designer a convenient and personalized solution for custom apparel shopping.

## Justification
The demand for personalized apparel is rapidly increasing in today's market, driven by consumers' desire for unique self-expression. Traditional retail stores often lack the variety and customization options that modern customers seek. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping has become a significant factor in purchasing decisions. Market research indicates a growing trend towards online customization platforms for clothing, highlighting the need for innovative ICT solutions in this sector. Existing ICT solutions in the market offer limited customization options and may not provide an intuitive user experience. Many platforms lack integration with virtual assistants, which can enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Therefore, there is a clear opportunity to develop a comprehensive custom shirt designing website that caters to the evolving needs of consumers.

## Goals
The primary goal of the Custom Shirt Designer project is to develop a user-friendly website that enables customers to design and purchase custom shirts with ease.
