# Iteration
Here, we decided to set the velocity (efficiency of work) to 0.7 as the project started. 
The work days for each iteration are divided by 3 developers and rounded up. 
After that, we divide it by our velocity to decide the total working days for each iteration. The velocity changes all the time.

## Iteration 1
- **Login/Sign in Page**
  - Estimation: 10 Days
  - Priority: 10

- **Catalog**
  - Estimation: 15 Days
  - Priority: 10

Total Work Days = 25 work days </br>
Each developer work days = 25/3 = 9 days </br>
Days required to get work done = 9/0.7 = 13 days

</br>

## Iteration 2
- **Specify Color**
  - Estimation: 2 Days
  - Priority: 10

- **Size Measurement**
  - Estimation: 2 Days
  - Priority: 10

- **Pay Online**
  - Estimation: 12 Days
  - Priority: 10

- **Delivery Service**
  - Estimation: 5 Days
  - Priority: 10

Total Work Days = 28 work days </br>
Each developer work days = 28/3 = 10 days </br>
Days required to get work done = 10/0.7 = 15 days

</br>

## Iteration 3
- **Shopping Cart**
  - Estimation: 7 Days
  - Priority: 20

- **Request Specific Design**
  - Estimation: 2 Days
  - Priority: 30

- **Purchase History**
  - Estimation: 7 Days
  - Priority: 40

- **Virtual Assistant**
  - Estimation: 15 Days
  - Priority: 50

Total Work Days = 31 work days </br>
Each developer work days = 31/3 = 11 days </br>
Days required to get work done = 11/0.7 = 16 days
