# Iteration
Here, we decided to set the velocity (efficiency of work) to 0.7 as the project started. 
The work days for each iteration are divided by 3 developers and rounded up. 
After that, we divide it by our velocity to decide the total working days for each iteration. The velocity changes all the time.
