## UML Description
This is the UML diagram for our general process of how the website is structured. The User, Payment Details, Virtual Assistant and Shirt have their own sets of methods works as the backhand for general purposes that may be called when necessary. Meanwhile, we have other classes with no given methods as they would be called the other classes that associates to them. For the User class, it has the attributes of the contents of the users that logs into the website or signed up, it also has its own methods to used when the user has either coupons or deals that associate to another class which is the Shopping Cart class. It also associates to other different classes such as the Payment Details, Virtual Assistant, and Shirt since all of the given attributes and methods may rely on the other classes, such as when Payment Detail class may require the Home Address attribute from the User class. Onto the remaining classes with no given methods, they only store attributes since they heavily aggregate from the User Class, which is the shopping cart. There is also association between them since the attributes may be combined to return the information of the product or delivery process that is associated from the User.
