## UI Description

The homepage shows all the offers. The shop page displays every available pre-designed shirt, while the features page allows users to design their own shirts. The contact page leads users to customer support or a virtual assistant to help them decide on their design. In the top right corner, there is a shopping cart that contains all the shirts the user has decided to buy or is keeping temporarily for review. The profile page can be accessed once the user has logged in to the website.
